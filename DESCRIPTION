Description: Avoid lots of manual click-around in the LimeSurvey web interface by simply creating and editing a user-friendly YAML file. This package converts that structured input so it can be imported directly into LimeSurvey to create a new survey. With this file-oriented approach, you have all the structure, content, and changes in your coding workflow.
