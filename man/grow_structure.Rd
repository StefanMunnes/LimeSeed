\title{Build survey structure (groups, questions, options)}
\usage{
grow_structure(tree, sprout = sprout)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A \code{limonaid::Survey} object, typically created by
\code{grow_settings()}.}

\item{sprout}{Named list as returned by \code{lime_sprout()} containing a
\code{structure} element that defines groups and questions.}
}
\value{
The modified \code{limonaid::Survey} object, returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Populates a \code{limonaid::Survey} R6 object with groups, questions, answer
options, and subquestions based on the \code{structure} element of a LimeSeed
sprout produced by \code{lime_sprout()}.
}
\details{
For each group defined in \code{sprout$structure}, a group is added to \code{tree}
using titles, descriptions, relevance, and randomization options. For each
question within a group, a \code{limonaid::Question} is created with its texts,
validation, relevance, display and behavior settings. If present, answer
options and subquestions are added supporting:
\itemize{
\item simple unnamed vectors (value used as both code and label),
\item named lists (names as codes), and
\item nested lists providing multilingual texts and additional attributes.
}

Messages are emitted to trace progress while building the structure. The
function modifies \code{tree} by reference and returns it invisibly.
